ParsipModeler
==============
A sketch-based modeling system that creates live objects which can deform naturally. The system supports a built-in scripting language to create complex scenegraphs for rendering and animation. Many of the functionalities are accelerated by the GPU and an easy to use front-end supports GPU rendering and compute shaders (via OpenGL and OpenCL standards).

==============
Feature List:

* High Performance rendering on Many-Core GPU Architectures

* Physically-based animation
 
* Flexible shading and effects

* Offline ray-tracing to create photorealistic images

* State-of-the-art Sketching techniques for designing complex volumetric models

* Easy to use Debugging tools and 3D Manipulators

==============
Future Works:

*Support for Haptic Devices
